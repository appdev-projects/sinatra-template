# OMNICALC 4

This app is an extension of the OMNICALC lessons from previous modules.

It features:

* Basic and scientific calculators

* GPT Chat

* Hangman and Tic-tac-toe games

Note :
I wrote this app mostly to see the limitations and strengths of the Ruby language.
It still needs work in a couple of areas :

 * Some of the code should be refactored.

 * Maybe use a different font, so that the images in the games line up better.

I hope you have as much fun with this app as I had writing it.
