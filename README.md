# OMNICALC 4

This app is an extension of the OMNICALC lessons from previous modules.

It features:

* Basic and scientific calculators

* GPT Chat

* Hangman and Tic-tac-toe games

Note :
I wrote this app mostly to see the limitations and strengths of the Ruby language.
It still needs work in a couple of areas :

 * Some of the code should be refactored.

 * Maybe use a different font, so that the images in the games line up better.

I hope you have as much fun with this app as I had writing it.

# How to use the app :

Basic calculator :
------------------

You should be able to use this calculator like a normal calculator.

Scientific calculator :
-----------------------

This can also be used as a normal calculator with an exception:  
The higher-math functions( exponent, factorial ) calls functions from mathjs api.
Here's the documentation : 
https://mathjs.org/docs/reference/functions.html

Chat GPT :
----------

* Ask a question in the text box below the controls and click "SEND".

* Use the up and down arrows to scroll through the answer.

Games ( Hangman ) :
-------------------

* Click on the letter that you want to guess.
  
* If the guess is incorrect, a portion of the man will be drawn, if the man is completely drawn, then the game is over.

* If you correctly guess the word, then you win and the game is over.

* Click the "RESET" button for a new game.

Games ( Tic-tac-toe ) :
